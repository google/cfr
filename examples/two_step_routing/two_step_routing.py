"""Implements a basic two-step route optimization algorithm on top of CFR.

Takes a Cloud Fleet Routing (CFR) request augmented with parking location data,
and creates a response that uses the given parking locations for deliveries.

Technically, the optimization is done by decomposing the original request into
a sequence of requests that solve parts of the optimization problem, and then
recombining them into full routes that include both driving and walking
directions.

On a high level, the solver does the following:
1. For each parking location, compute optimized routes for shipments that are
   delivered from this parking location. These routes start at the parking
   location and visit one or more final delivery locations. Additional
   constraints may be used to limit the length of these local routes.

   These optimized routes are used in two ways:
     - they provide an estimation of the time necessary to serve each parking
       location; this estimate is used in the global plan.
     - they are included in the final routes.

2. Based on the results from step 1, compute optimized routes that connect the
   parking locations and shipments that are delivered directly to the customer
   location (i.e. they are not delivered through a parking location).

   All shipments that are delivered through a parking location are represented
   by one (or more) "virtual" shipments that represent the parking location and
   its shipments. This shipment has has the coordinates of the parking location
   and the visit duration is equivalent to the time needed to deliver the
   shipments from the parking location.

3. The results from both plans are merged into a final plan that includes both
   directions for "driving" from the depots to the parking locations (and to
   custommer sites that are not served from a parking locatio) and directions
   for "walking" from the parking location to the final delivery locations.

   This plan contains all shipments from the original request, and pairs of
   "virtual" shipments that represent arrivals to and departures from parking
   locations.

    The merged request and response incorporate both the global "driving" routes
    from the global model and the local "walking" routes from the local model.
    The merged request uses the same shipments as the original request, extended
    with "virtual" shipments used to represent parking location arrivals and
    departures in the merged routes.

    Each parking location visit from the global plan is replaced by a visit to
    a virtual shipment that represents the arrival to the parking location, then
    all shipments delivered from the parking location, and then another virtual
    shipment that represents the departure from the parking location. The
    virtual shipments use the coordinates of the parking location as their
    position; the actual shipments delivered through the parking location and
    transitions between them are taken from the local plan.

    The request and the response follow the same structure as standard CFR JSON
    requests, but they do not use all fields, and sending the merged request to
    the CFR API endpoint would not produce the merged response. The pair can
    however be used for example to inspect the solution in the fleet routing app
    or be used by other applications that consume a CFR response.

    Args:
      local_response: A solution of the local model created by
        self.make_local_request(). The local request itself is not needed.
      global_response: A solution of the global model created by
        self.make_global_request(local_response). The global request itself is
        not needed.

    Returns:
      A tuple (merged_request, merged_response) that contains the merged data
      from the original request and the local and global results.

      Note that, for efficiency reasons, the returned data structure may contain
      parts of the input data strucutres, and it is thus not safe to mutate. If
      mutating it is needed, first make a copy via copy.deepcopy().
