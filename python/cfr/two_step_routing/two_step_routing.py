"""Implements a basic two-step route optimization algorithm on top of CFR.

Takes a Cloud Fleet Routing (CFR) request augmented with parking location data,
and creates a response that uses the given parking locations for deliveries.

Technically, the optimization is done by decomposing the original request into
a sequence of requests that solve parts of the optimization problem, and then
recombining them into full routes that include both driving and walking
directions.

On a high level, the solver does the following:
1. For each parking location, compute optimized routes for shipments that are
   delivered from this parking location. These routes start at the parking
   location and visit one or more final delivery locations. Additional
   constraints may be used to limit the length of these local routes.

   These optimized routes are used in two ways:
     - they provide an estimation of the time necessary to serve each parking
       location; this estimate is used in the global plan.
     - they are included in the final routes.

2. Based on the results from step 1, compute optimized routes that connect the
   parking locations and shipments that are delivered directly to the customer
   location (i.e. they are not delivered through a parking location).

   All shipments that are delivered through a parking location are represented
   by one (or more) "virtual" shipments that represent the parking location and
   its shipments. This shipment has has the waypoint of the parking location
   and the visit duration is equivalent to the time needed to deliver the
   shipments from the parking location.

3. The results from both plans are merged into a final plan that includes both
   directions for "driving" from the depots to the parking locations (and to
   custommer sites that are not served from a parking locatio) and directions
   for "walking" from the parking location to the final delivery locations.

   This plan contains all shipments from the original request, and pairs of
   "virtual" shipments that represent arrivals to and departures from parking
   locations.

      object. Exactly one of `coordinates` and `waypoint` must be provided.
    waypoint: The waypoint for the parking location. When delivering a shipment
      using the two-step delivery, the driver first parks at this waypoint, and
      then uses a different mode of transport to the final delivery locations.
      Exactly one of `coordinates` and `waypoint` must be provided.
    tag: A unique name used for the parking location. Used to match parking
      locations in `ShipmentParkingMap`, and it is also used in the labels of
      the virtual shipments generated for parking locations by the planner.
    travel_mode: The travel mode used in the CFR requests when computing
      optimized routes from the parking lot to the final delivery locations.
      Overrides `Vehicle.travel_mode` for vehicles used in the local route
      optimization plan.
    travel_duration_multiple: The travel duration multiple used when computing
      optimized routes from the parking lot to the final delivery locations.
      Overrides `Vehicle.travel_duration_multiple` for vehicles used in the
      local route optimization plan.
    avoid_indoor: The value of the `routeModifiers.avoidIndoor` option used in
      local delivery routes from this parking location. When `None`, the option
      will not be set. This option can be set to True only for when walking
      directions are used, i.e. when `travel_mode` == 2.
    delivery_load_limits: The load limits applied when delivering shipments from
      the parking location. This is equivalent to Vehicle.loadLimits, and it
      restricts the number of shipments that can be delivered without returning
      to the parking location. When the number of shipments delivered from the
      parking location exceeds this limit, the model will create multiple routes
      starting and ending at the parking location that will appear as multiple
      visits to the parking location in the global model. Since the local model
      allows only very limited cost tuning, we accept only one value per unit,
      and this value is used as the hard limit.
    max_round_duration: The maximal duration of one delivery round from the
      parking location. When None, there is no limit on the maximal duration of
      one round.
    arrival_duration: The time that is spent when a vehicle arrives to the
      parking location. This time is added to the total duration of the route
      whenever the vehicle arrives to the parking location from a different
      location. Can be used to model the time required to enter a parking lot,
      park the vehicle, and pick up the shipments for the first delivery round.
    departure_duration: The time that is spent when a vehicle leaves the parking
      location. This time is added to the total duration of the route whenever
      the vehicle leaves the parking location for a different location. Can be
      used to model the time needed to leave a parking lot.
    reload_duration: The time that is spent at the parking location between two
      consecutive delivery rounds from the parking location. Can be used to
      model the time required to pick up packages from the vehicle before
      another round of pickups.
    arrival_cost: The cost of entering the parking location. The cost is applied
      when a vehicle enters the parking location from another location.
    departure_cost: The cost of leaving the parking location. The cost is
      applied when a vehicle leaves the parking location for another location.

    """Creates a refinement request for local routes for a complete solution.

    The refinement is done by re-optimizing the local (walking/biking) routes
    whenever there is a sequence of consecutive visits to the same parking
    location. This re-optimization is done on visits from all visits to the
    parking location in the sequence, so that the solver can reorganize how the
    local delivery rounds are done.

    This phase is different from the original local model in the sense that it:
      - always uses the original visit time windows for the visits in the plan,
      - uses a pickup & delivery model with a single vehicle and capacities to
        make sure that the result is a sequence of delivery rounds.
      - uses the original delivery rounds as an injected initial solution, so
        the refined solution should always have the same or better cost.

    Outline of the design of the model:
      - Each shipment is represented as a pickup (at the parking location) and a
        delivery (at the delivery address). If the original shipment had a time
        window constraint, the new shipment will have the same time window on
        the delivery request. All shipments are mandatory.
      - There is a single vehicle with capacity constraints corresponding to the
        capacity constraints for delivery from this parking location. The
        vehicle start and end time are flexible, but they are restricted to the
        start/end time of the sequence of visits to the parking location in the
        original solution.
      - The capacity constraint makes the "vehicle" return to the parking
        location when there are more shipments than can be delivered in one
        round. At the same time, by using a single vehicle, we make sure that
        the delivery rounds that we get out of the optimization can be executed
        by one driver in a sequence.
      - The model minimizes the total time and the total distance. Compared to
        the base local model, the cost per km and cost per hour are the same,
        but there is an additional steep cost for using more time than the
        solution of the base local model.

    Args:
      local_response: The original solution of the "local" part of the model.
      global_response: The original solution of the "global" part of the model.

    Returns:
      A new CFR request that models the refinement of local routes based on the
      solution of the global model.

    3. a first solution hint for the integrated global request; this first
      solution is created from the solution of the base global model by
      replacing the refined parts.

    The integrated global model needs to be re-solved via CFR to (1) update
    arrival and departure times in the solution, (2) inject road traffic
    information if requested, and (3) use any time saved by the refinement to
