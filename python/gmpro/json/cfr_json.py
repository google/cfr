    assumes that the break is taken in full within the working hours of the
    vehicle. This may underestimate the maximal working hours in case where the
    start time or end time are flexible and some breaks may be avoided by moving
    them.
  Both limitations would require solving an optimization problem to determine
  the max working hours correctly.
