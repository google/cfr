  """Splits `shipment` into multiple smaller shipments if needed.

  Assumes that `shipment` is a CFR shipment that contains multiple items that
  need to be delivered, and that
  - the label contains a comma-separated list of items in the shipment,
  - the number of shipments is recorded in `loadDemands` of the shipment under
    the name `num_items_key`,
  - all other load demands specify different types of items in the shipment, and
    their sum is smaller or equal to the number of items in the shipment.

  When the number of items in the shipment is greater than `max_items`, returns
  multiple shipments that each contain at most `max_items` items. The item
  labels from the original shipment label are distributed across these shipments
  and so are the item type load demands. The function has no way of knowing
  which item type corresponds to which item label, so it assigns them
  arbitrarily and it's thus recommended only for experimental use.

  Note that the function modifies `shipment` in place and yields only newly
  created shipments. This way, the original shipment object can be kept in the
  list of shipments at its original spot (so that its shipment index is
  preserved), while the new shipments can be added at the end of the list with
  new shipment indices (i.e. they do not disturb shipment indices of other
  shipments).

  Also note that the function may change objects that it already yielded until
  it stops iteration.

  Args:
    shipment: The shipment to (maybe) split. The shipment is modified in place.
    num_items_load_type: The name of the key in `loadDemands` of the shipment
      that contains the number of items in the shipment.
    max_items: The maximal number of items per shipment.

  Yields:
