r"""A command-line utility that transforms CFR request JSON files.

Reads a CFR request file in the JSON format, transforms it according to the
parameters provided via command-line flags and writes the modified file to
another file in the JSON format.

Typical usage:
  python3 -m cfr.json.transform_request \
    --input_file "scenario.json" \
    --output_file "scenario.all_optional.json" \
    --shipment_penalty_cost_per_item=1000

  """Specifies how the number of "actual" shipments per CFR shipment is counted.

  In the requests processed by this script, we assume that multiple items
  (packages, actions, ...) can be represented by a single Shipment object in a
  CFR request, when they are all performed at the same location and time, e.g.
  when there are multiple packages delivered to the same recipient. Most of the
  transformations done by this script work on CFR shipments and it makes no
  difference how mnay "actual" shipments are concerned. However, it does make
  a difference in few cases (e.g. when computing the `penaltyCost` for a
  Shipment object).

  To avoid confusion, we use the following vocabulary to distinguish the two:
  - "CFR shipments" are the Shipment objects in a CFR request.
  - "actual shipments" are the actual items (packages, ...) represented by a CFR
    shipment.
  One CFR shipment always represents one or more actual shipments.

  The CFR API does not have an explicit way to store this information, and it
  needs to be inferred from other properties of a CFR shipment. This enum
  contains a list of strategies how the number of actual shipments represented
  by one CFR shipment can be inferred.

  Values:
    ONE_PER_CFR_SHIPMENT: Each CFR shipment corresponds to one actual shipment.
    COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_IN_LABEL: The label of each CFR shipment contains a
      comma separated list of labels (identifiers) of actual shipments. The
      number of actual shipments is computed as the length of the list of items
      in the label.
