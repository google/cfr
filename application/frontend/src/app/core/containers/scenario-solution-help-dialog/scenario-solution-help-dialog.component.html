</h3>
<p>
  A scenario is a vehicle routing problem (VRP) request that Fleet Routing can solve. It consists of
  one or more vehicles and one or more shipments to be delivered.
</p>

<p>
  A solution is what the Fleet Routing API produces in response to a request to solve a scenario.
  Solutions are visible in FleetRouting App via the Gantt chart, on a map, or in the Metadata view.
